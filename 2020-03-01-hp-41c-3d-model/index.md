A highly detailed [model of the HP-41C calculator](http://blog.atlant.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/HP-41C.easm) in EASM format.

The model model was initially created by [Jean-Michel Lecointre](https://www.hpmuseum.org/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/hpmuseum/archv017.cgi?read=117508), and kept safe by [Massimo Gnerucci](https://www.hpmuseum.org/forum/user-56.html).

I converted it to [blender format](http://blog.atlant.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/HP-41D.blend).
