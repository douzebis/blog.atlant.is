Top definition from [the urban dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=A%20Karen):

A Karen is a kind of person who is unhappy when [little things](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=little%20things) don’t go their way. They are a “Can I speak to your manager?” kind of gal. The bitchy [soccer mom](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=soccer%20mom) of her [friend group](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=friend%20group) that nobody likes.

_“Do you see her over there? She’s such a Karen.”_

_“Hi! You put meat on [my son](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=my%20son)’s [turkey sandwich](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=turkey%20sandwich), when he is STRICTLY VEGETARIAN. If you know what’s [good for you](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=good%20for%20you), you’ll direct your manager over to me right away.”_
