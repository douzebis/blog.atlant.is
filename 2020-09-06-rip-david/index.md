As [Malcolm Harris](https://www.thenation.com/authors/malcolm-harris/) recalls on [his September 9th paper](https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/david-graeber-obit/):

> I met David Graeber on August 2, 2011, at the first general assembly of Occupy Wall Street. The GA was chaotic, with socialists using a microphone to try to wrangle us anarchists. We wanted something a little less hierarchical, so a handful of us got up and sat in a circle at the other side of the small Wall Street park. Graeber saw us and came over to introduce himself: “Hi, I’m David. Can I sit with you?”
