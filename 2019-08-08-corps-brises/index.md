[bODY rEMIX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNh9488y0WI) is dedicated to the vulnerability of the body and physical pain, hidden behind the beauty, lightness and grace of the dance. [Marie Chouinard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZtJqKmc_bs&list=PL7C78A8F23ABCEFBB&index=10), body sculptor and irreconcilable radical, wrings the bodies into flesh / crutches hybrids.

This work, first shown at the Venice Biennale in 2005, is all the more stunning thanks to Louis Dufort's shattered collage of Glenn Gould's voice and interpretation of Bach's Goldberg Variationen.

Parallel to David Cronenberg's obsession with flesh / machine chimeras : Rosanna Arquette in Crash (1996) and her costume exposed during _[The Exhibition](https://200-percent.com/tag/david-cronenberg/)_ at the EYE film museum in Amsterdam (2014).
