Violent protests continue to boil over in Minneapolis after the death of George Floyd. Rioters set on fire the 3rd Precinct police building.

On Friday, May 29th, four days after the [video-recorded, snuff-style, lynch-style, cold-blooded murder of George Floyd](https://youtu.be/DNX8-PWCi6E?t=668) by four officers of the police of Minneapolis, Minnesota, one of the officers was charged with third degree murder by Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman.

Third degree murder as defined in [section 609.195](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.195) of the Minnesota Statutes, 2019:

Murder in the third degree: _whoever, **without intent to effect the death of any person,** causes the death of another by perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life, is guilty of murder in the third degree and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than 25 years._

Seriously?

But then, as [attorney general Nekima Keith Ellison said](https://www.democracynow.org/2020/5/28/george_floyd_death_minneapolis_protests) on Thursday on Democracy Now!: "We simply do not trust the Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to make a fair and objective decision, because typically he sides with law enforcement officers. He has not held a single officer accountable for shooting a civilian, for killing a civilian, except in the case of Justine Damond, who was a white, affluent woman who was shot and killed by a Black Muslim Somali man. And we saw, after a period of time, where Mike Freeman actually did bring charges, and ultimately Mohamed Noor was convicted, and he is spending time in prison. Most of the officers who kill people in Minneapolis and in the state of Minnesota are white men, but not one has been charged and convicted for killing a Black person in the state of Minnesota."

Now for the blunt hypocrisy part...  
  
On Tuesday, May 26th, the Minneapolis Police Department titled a [news release describing the murder](https://www.insidempd.com/2020/05/26/man-dies-after-medical-incident-during-police-interaction/) as "Man Dies **After Medical Incident** During Police Interaction." Look below for a masterpiece of understatement (aka lying by omission).

> Man Dies After Medical Incident During Police Interaction  
>   
> May 25, 2020 (MINNEAPOLIS) On Monday evening, shortly after 8:00 pm, officers from the Minneapolis Police Department responded to the 3700 block of Chicago Avenue South on a report of a forgery in progress.  Officers were advised that the suspect was sitting on top of a blue car and appeared to be under the influence.  
>   
> Two officers arrived and located the suspect, a male believed to be in his 40s, in his car.  He was ordered to step from his car.  After he got out, he physically resisted officers.  Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress.  Officers called for an ambulance.  He was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center by ambulance where he died a short time later.

On Thursday, May 28th, the MPD [published on their website](http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/police/records/frequent) a response to Frequently Requested Public Information about the murder, **including an allegation unsubstantiated by the videos** of the event:

May 29th update: it looks like the State of Minnesota County of Hennepin District Court 4th Judicial District is paving the way for a programmed acquittal of Derek Chauvin. Have a look at [the criminal complaint](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/chauvin-complaint.pdf). The included _statement of probable cause_ reads:

> **Mr. Floyd actively resisted** being handcuffed \[...\] The autopsy revealed **no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation**. Mr. Floyd had underlying health conditions including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease. The **combined effects of** Mr. Floyd **being restrained** by the police, his **underlying health conditions** and any potential **intoxicants in his system** likely contributed to his death.

In other words: <sarcasm> Mr. Floyd died because he was an aggressive junkie, officer Derek Chauvin has very little to do with it. </sarcasm>
