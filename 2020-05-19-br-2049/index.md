And blood-black nothingness began to spin  
  
A system of cells interlinked within  
  
Cells interlinked within cells interlinked  
  
Within one stem. And dreadfully distinct  
  
Against the dark, a tall white fountain played.  

\-- Vladimir Nobokov, _Pale Fire_

\-- Also ending of _[Blade Runner 2049](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856101/)_, as per [Hampton Fancher and Michael Green screenplay](http://blog.atlant.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/blade-runner-2049-shooting-script.pdf), page 107. Did not make it to the theatrical release, though.
