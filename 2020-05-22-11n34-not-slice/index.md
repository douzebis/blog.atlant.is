Inspiring young mathematician Lisa Piccirillo

[Lisa Piccirillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Piccirillo) from University of Texas, Austin, recently published a [paper in the annals of mathematics](https://annals.math.princeton.edu/2020/191-2/p05) solving a long-unsolved topology problem : the Conway knot ([11n34 in the Rolfsen tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway_knot)) is not slice.

[Quantamagazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/) has a [nice article about it](https://www.quantamagazine.org/graduate-student-solves-decades-old-conway-knot-problem-20200519/), and the paper itself is [available on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02923). Sadly the subject is too involved and I don't have the background to understand the paper.

Following the publication, Lisa Piccirillo was offered a tenure-track position at MIT, set to begin fourteen months after the completion of her doctorate.

Also from the inspiring doctorand: a [nice video](https://youtu.be/mIwf4-ayBLA?t=52) where she gives her take on _the nature of abstract Math_. Lisa's tentative definition: _Math is asking and answering of rigorously defined interesting questions_.
