A useful plugin by [Katie Seaborn](http://katieseaborn.com/) to manage bibliography for your articles: brings Zotero and scholarly blogging to your WordPress website.

There is a small glitch with [version](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2169267/zotpress) [7.1.5](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2375593/zotpress) and WordPress Twenty Twenty theme: the bibliography block is flushed to the left instead of being aligned with the other blocks.

Enjoy this [quick hack](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2905):

Update: [version 7.1.6](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2375593/zotpress) provides a clean fix for the problem.
