Allegedly, Epstein's lawyers had recently been signaling his most powerful friends' secrets were safe with him ; apparently this was not sufficient to prevent him from committing suicide.

Epstein used to fly [such friends](http://www.businessinsider.fr/us/famous-people-jeffery-epstein-money-manager-sexual-trafficking-connected-2019-7) as President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, or Prince Andrew Duke of York to his _Little Saint James_, U.S. Virgin Islands private property, where he was able to entertain them.
